The SOLID principles of object-oriented programming help make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

They also make it easy to create readable and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work with anywhere and anytime. And they make you aware of the best way to write code ðŸ’ª.

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym that stands for the five design principles of Object-Oriented class design. These principles are:

- S - Single-responsibility Principle
- O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle

In this article, you will learn what these principles stand for and how they work using JavaScript examples. The examples should be fine even if you are not fully conversant with JavaScript, because they apply to other programming languages as well.
